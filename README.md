# pyxl shoes

#### By _**Kendra Kelly**_

## Description
This project is to build a trendy shoe site & branding. Used to practice with media queries and responsive design.

## Brand Identity
A trendy new shoe brand is about to launch. They're attempting to become the next big name in a type of fashion they call streetwear, but need a site to represent their brand and complete online sales. They tried making their own, but didn't get anywhere. So they've hired you!

When describing their brand and vision, they use the words "cool" and "like a viral phenomenon" more times than you can count.
You're not sure if you agree with this desire ethically, but you did hear them say "We want to be one of those brands where people pay $200 for a ball cap just because it has our name on it. Even if it's just a $6 ballcap. You know?"
They also told you "We want to feel illusive and viral. Like a brand that just popped up out of nowhere, and no one really knows the story. But in an appealing way."
They let you know doing limited releases of all our stuff. No restocks. No reprints. They want this to be emphasized, so people feel like all their products are one-of-a-kind and hard-to-get.
